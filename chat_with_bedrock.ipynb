       "\n",
       "1. **Document Preprocessing**: \n",
       "   - Tokenization using NLTK\n",
       "   - Stop word removal\n",
       "   - Lemmatization for better term matching\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Positional Inverted Index**:\n",
       "   - Maps each term to document IDs and position occurrences\n",
       "   - Enables efficient boolean query processing\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Boolean Query Processing**:\n",
       "   - Supports AND, OR, NOT operations\n",
       "   - Query optimization by processing rarer terms first\n",
       "   - Detailed analysis of query performance\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Context-Sensitive Spell Correction**:\n",
       "   - Medical terminology dictionary\n",
       "   - Uses difflib for fuzzy string matching\n",
       "   - Improves retrieval quality for misspelled queries\n",
       "\n",
       "## Features Demonstrated:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **10 Sample Medical Documents**: Includes discharge summaries, patient notes, treatment protocols\n",
       "- **Complex Query Analysis**: Processes `covid AND vaccine AND NOT allergy` with optimization\n",
       "- **Spell Correction Examples**: Shows improvement in retrieval quality\n",
       "- **Performance Analysis**: Term frequency analysis and optimization strategies\n",
       "\n",
       "The system handles medical terminology accurately and provides robust search capabilities for healthcare information retrieval scenarios."

    "Based on the simulation results of 1000 iterations across different Multi-Armed Bandit policies\n",
    "for adaptive treatment selection, several key insights emerge:\n",
    "\n",
    "PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:\n",
    "The UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) policy demonstrated superior performance in balancing exploration\n",
    "and exploitation, consistently achieving higher cumulative rewards compared to other strategies.\n",
    "The ε-Greedy policy with optimal epsilon value also showed competitive performance, while the\n",
    "pure Greedy policy suffered from premature convergence to suboptimal arms due to insufficient\n",
    "exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "EXPLORATION vs EXPLOITATION TRADE-OFF:\n",
    "The Random policy provided maximum exploration but failed to exploit learned knowledge, resulting\n",
    "in consistently lower rewards. The Greedy policy, conversely, exploited too aggressively without\n",
    "adequate exploration, potentially missing better treatment options. The ε-Greedy policies with\n",
    "different epsilon values showed that moderate exploration (ε=0.1-0.2) generally outperformed\n",
    "high exploration (ε=0.5), indicating that in clinical settings, a conservative exploration\n",
    "approach is more beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:\n",
    "The UCB policy's success suggests that confidence-based treatment selection, which considers\n",
    "both the estimated effectiveness and uncertainty of each treatment, is most suitable for\n",
    "clinical trial scenarios. This approach ensures that promising treatments receive more attention\n",
    "while maintaining sufficient exploration of all options, crucial for patient safety and\n",
    "treatment optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "RECOMMENDATION:\n",
    "For adaptive clinical trials, the UCB policy is recommended as it provides the best balance\n",
    "between exploring new treatments and exploiting known effective ones, ultimately leading to\n",
    "better patient outcomes while maintaining ethical treatment allocation standards.\n",
